Wrestling Trivia Discord Bot for Internet Wrestling Discord

## Introudction
TriviaBot is a Discord bot built using Javascript (with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)) using the [Discord.js library](https://discord.js.org) for the [Profesional Wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling) community server, [Internet Wrestling Discord](https://wrestlingdiscord.com/)  that randomly spawns "trivia events", spontaneous trivia sessions where users have 10 seconds to answer a multiple choice wrestling related question for the chance to win the hardcore champion role.

## Trivia Defending
TriviaBot tracks the messages the Hardcore Champion makes in IWD's wrestling channels and has an adjustable % chance of spawning a trivia defense each message. Each trivia defense will ping the champion role and ask a piece of wrestling related trivia. All users in the channel will have 10 seconds to correctly answer the piece of trivia (multiple choice A/B/C/D). The role is randomly raffled between all those who answered correctly.

## Trivia Bank
Trivia questions and answers are stored on a Google Sheets spreadsheet. A Google Form is set up allowing staff members and community contributors to submit trivia which will be manually moved to the spreadsheet when approved.

## Manual Trivia Switch
The Administrators can manually enable and disable trivia defending. This will be used when IWD ocassionaly offers the belt for Indie predictions.

## Manual Defense
The Administrators can manually force a title defence if the current champion is actively avoiding talk in wrestling channels or is inactive for an extended period of time. When the command is triggered, users have 30 seconds to type `!fight` in that channel to enter the raffle. A random winner is awarded the title.
